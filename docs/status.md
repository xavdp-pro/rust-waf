# Actual status — 2026-10-01

## Implemented

`waf-core` parses versioned JSON profiles, rejects unknown and duplicate top-level fields, composes a selected core → application → site chain, fingerprints its canonical representation, preserves rule provenance and declares scoped site exceptions. Limits may tighten only. Core parsing, ingress, forwarding and authentication invariants cannot be excepted. WordPress is an application profile; its routes do not belong in engine code.

Eight integration tests cover ordering, fingerprints, missing parents, selected-chain cycles, duplicate identities, invariant/product constraints, bounds, explicit exception scope, invalid regular expressions and silent rule overrides.

Reproduce with `cargo test --workspace --locked`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`, `python3 tools/check_repository.py` and `python3 observability/evaluate_waf.py --self-test`. All passed locally. Run `cargo run --locked -p waf-core --example compose -- example-site profiles/core/base.json profiles/wordpress/base.json profiles/sites/example.json` to inspect the fictional composition fingerprint.

## Not implemented or proven

HTTP transport, complete request inspection, common rules, WordPress specialization, temporary bans and deployment remain pending. Composition tests and the synthetic scorer are not effectiveness evidence. No detection rate, false-positive rate or proxy overhead has been measured. Public profile examples retain their design-only metadata because they contain no enforcement rules. Origin metrics still report the pre-engine state.
